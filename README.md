# ScriptAddin
Simple Excel-DNA based Add-in for handling Scripts (R, Python, Perl, whatever you define) from Excel, storing input objects (scalars/vectors/matrices) 
and retrieving result objects (scalars/vectors/matrices) as text files (currently restricted to tab separated).
Graphics are retrieved from produced png files into Excel to be displayed as diagrams.
